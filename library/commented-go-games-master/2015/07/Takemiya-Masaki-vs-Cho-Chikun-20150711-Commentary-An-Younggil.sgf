The game was played between Takemiya Masaki 9p and Cho Chikun on July 11, 2015, in Tokyo, Japan.

The Igo Masters Cup is a tournament for veteran players over the age of 50 in Japan.


Cho Chikun 9p was born in 1956 in Korea, and he went to Japan to study Go when he was 6 years old.

He became a pro in 1968 when he was only 11 years old, and he took his first major title (the Pro Best Ten) in 1975.

He never stopped playing in his career, and he's won 73 titles in total, and that's a record in Japan. The former record holder was Sakata Eio 9p (1920~2010) with 64 titles in his career.

Cho also won two international titles – the 4th Fujitsu Cup in 1991, and the 8th Samsung Cup in 2003 defeating Park Younghun 9p.

At the time, Cho was 47 years old, and Park was only 18. That was amazing to see Cho defeating far younger opponent to win another international title.

In 2012, he achieved 1400 career wins, which was also a new record in Japan, and he still doesn't stop going.

He won the 1st Igo Masters Cup by defeating Kobayashi Koichi 9p in 2011, and he won the 4th Igo Masters Cup again by defeating Kobayashi Satoru 9p in 2014, and he was aiming to add once more in this final.


Takemiya Masaki was born in 1951, and he became a pro in 1965.

He won the 31st Honinbo title defeating Ishida yoshio in 1976, and it was his first major title in his career.

In the following year, he lost Honinbo title against Cho Chikun, but he came back to win Honinbo again, and he won five more times afterwards.

He was holding Honinbo for four consecutive years from 1985 to 1988, and was hoping for the Honorary Honinbo by defending one more year. However, Cho Chikun was the challenger in 1989, and Takemiya didn't succeed to defend.

In 1988, the first international title, Fujitsu Cup, was established, and Takemiya became the first international champion of the historic title. He won the 1st Fujitsu Cup, by defeating Rin Kaiho 9p in the final.

He wasn't satisfied enough with his victory, and he won the 2nd of Fujitsu Cup defeating Rin Kaiho again in 1989.

In the same year, the first international lightning Go tournament was established as well. In the 1st Asian TV Cup, Takemiya became the first winner again by defeating Kobayashi Satoru 9p in the final.

He was very good at this tournament, and he continued winning this title three more times by defeating Lee Changho 9p, Cao Dayuan 9p and Cho Hun Hyun 9p respectively in the finals.

In 1995, he won the 20th Meijin defeating Kobayashi Koichi 9p, and it was his first Meijin title. However, he lost to Cho Chikun in the following year again.

In 2009, he proceeded to the final of the 56th NHK Cup, but lost to Yuki Satoshi 9p.

This was his first final from this Igo Masters Cup, and an exciting match was set up for the final.


They both were from the Kitani dojo (Kitani Minoru 9p, 1909~1975). However, ironically their style of play is completely opposite.

Cho’s style of play is very dynamic and passionate. He used to play extreme territorial games when he was in his 30s, and he was also famous for his long time thinking with his accurate moves in byoyomi.

He's regarded the master of two day matches from the big three major title matches (Kisei, Meijin and Honinbo), and he was playing frantically in the last byoyomi in most of his games.

On the other hand, Takemiya was very famous for his cosmic style of play. He called it 'nature style' himself, but people likes to call it cosmic style.

His moyo style of play was very new and sensational by the time, and most go fans were impressed and fascinated by his humongous moyo games.

His unique center oriented style of play with his creative point of view was romantic and dreaming, which is nobody can mimic and win, so he was very highly regarded from other top players.

I liked their styles of play very much, so I enjoyed replaying their games a lot when I was an insei. Their games were always exciting and fun to watch with their opposite colorful style.

;W[gb]LB[gb:72][ic:B][lf:A]C[White won by 5.5 points at the end of move 272.

Cho Chikun won the 5th Igo Masters Cup, and that was his 3rd time victory in this tournament. That was his 74th title of his career at the same time, and he broke his own record of the most number of titles in Japan again.

Both Cho and Takemiya played with thier typical style of play, and the game was quite interesting to watch.

The opening was well balanced between influence and territory, but Black played several slack moves to allow White to take a lead.

I couldn't find any mistakes from White, and that can be another masterpiece by Cho. White's moves were solid and accurate, and the attachment at A was the winning shot.

On the other hand, Takemiya showed his creative and brilliant sense in the center, and the game was still quite close before he made a mistake at B. 

Even though he lost this game, most Go fans will still regard him as a pioneer of the center in Go, and one of the greatest players in the history of Go as well.

I was happy to watch and comment their wonderful game again.

I hope you to enjoy watching this game more with this commentary, and if you have any questions or opinions, please feel free to leave a comment.

Thanks,
