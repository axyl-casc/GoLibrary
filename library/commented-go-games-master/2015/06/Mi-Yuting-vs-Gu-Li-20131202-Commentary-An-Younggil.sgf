PW[Gu Li]PB[Mi Yuting]WR[9p]BR[4p]DT[2013-12-2]EV[MLily Cup ]RO[Final, Game 2]SO[gogameguru.com]C[This is game 2 from the 1st MLily Cup final. 

The game was played between Gu Li 9p and Mi Yuting 4p on December 2, 2013, in Jiangsu, China.

Gu Li won game 1 of the final, so if Gu wins this game again, it'd be an easy series for him in the best of five. 


Gu Li was ranked #3 in China by the time the game was played, and he's still one of the most popular players along with Lee Sedol 9p in the world today.

Gu's already won seven international titles in his career before this final, and the last time was the 15th Samsung Cup in 2010. (He added another international title - 10th Chunlan Cup in June, 2015)

His style of play is quite unique. His opening is outstanding, and he often played creative moves which soon become popular. 

His haengma is strong and firm, and his power at the fighting is destructive. Most of his games are dynamic and thrilling with his brilliant and creative moves, and that's the main reason why people like to watch his games so much. 

In this Mlily Cup, he defeated Na Hyun 3p, Hu Yaoyu 9p, Wang Lei 6p, and Zhou Ruiyang 9p to proceeded to the final.

MLily Gu vs Lee Jubango was going to start in two months from this final, so Gu really wanted to win this MLily Cup, and play the jubango as world champion.


Mi Yuting was born in 1996, and he became a pro in 2007. His ranking was #7 in China by the time of this final, but he was yet unknown internationally by then.

His best results in the international tournaments before this MLily Cup was round of 16. He proceeded to the round of 16 both at the 2012 Samsung Cup and the 4th BC Card Cup in 2012. 

However, his performance in this MLily Cup was very impressive and sensational. 

He defeated Lee Sedol 9p, Kang Dongyun 9p, Kong Jie 9p, Dang Yifei 4p and Wang Xi 9p to reach the final. All of his opponents were either world champion or finalist of an international tournament, and Mi defeated them all.

He was relatively unknown, but his reading was already propound and accurate especially at the close combat. He's also got strong mind as well, so he maintained his calm when he was in trouble, although he was only 17 year old boy.

By the way, Gu is very good at that sort of aji of White 86, and that was quite tricky to respond. However, Black 87 was a clever response, and White lost some points, because playing A to C isn't sente for White anymore.

A and B are miai for Black to live, and Gu resigned.

Mi Yuting made the final tie with 1-1 score with this victory, and he won game 3 and game 4 as well, and he became the inaugural winner of the MLily Cup defeating Gu Li with 3-1 score. 

He became 9p straight away as well as a new world Champion.


The game was started with a new variation from the Chinese Opening. 

The attachment at White C was unusual, and Black D was questionable. 

White E wasn't good, and the result up to F was still well balanced. 

Black got a nice result up to G, but White H was Gu Li's brilliant probe, and the game became even again. 

White I was a critical mistake, and when black lived on the left side, the game was practically over. 

Gu tried very hard to catch up afterwards, but Black J was the finishing blow, and Mi's defence was perfect.

Mi Yuting showed his strongness at the close combat, especially at the late fighting on the left hand side. Gu Li tried to make the game complicated after that, but Mi's responses against White's tricky moves were accurate, and he finished the game without any trouble.

On the other hand, it was a sad ending for Gu Li. He played very well with his style of play in this game, and he showed brilliant moves as well.

However, he made a crucial mistake at I, and the game was suddenly decided. Unfortunately, there weren't many things what Gu could do afterwards.

Although Gu didn't win this MLily Cup, he came back to the world champion in June 2015, winning the10th Chunlan Cup.


I hope you to enjoy watching this exciting game more with this commentary, and if you have any questions of opinions, please feel free to leave a comment.
