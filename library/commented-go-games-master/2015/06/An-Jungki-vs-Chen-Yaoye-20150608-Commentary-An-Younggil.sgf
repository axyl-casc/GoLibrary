GN[An-Jungki-vs-Chen-Yaoye-20150608]PW[Chen Yaoye]PB[An Jungki]WR[9p]BR[5d]DT[2015-06-08]EV[20th LG Cup]RO[Round of 32]PC[Kangwon, Korea]SO[https://gogameguru.com/]C[This is game from the 20th LG Cup, round of 32.

The game was played between An Jungki 5d amateur and Chen Yaoye 9p on June 8, 2015, in Kangwon, Korea.


Chen Yaoye is currently ranked #6 in China.

He’s held the Tianyuan title for seven years in a row now. He defeated Mi Yiting 9p in April 2015, and it was the most recent defending match for Chen.

Chen won the 9th Chunlan Cup in 2013 defeating Lee Sedol 9p, but he hasn’t added any international titles since then. However, he’s still regarded as one of the best players in the world.

Chen used to be good at this LG Cup. He was on the final of the 10th LG Cup in 2006, and that was his first international title match. Even though he lost to Gu Li 9p, it wasn't bad for a 16 year old boy.

In 2013, Chen was on the semifinals of the 18th LG Cup, but he was defeated by Zhou Ruiyang 9p. 

At the end of 2014, he went to semifinals of the 10th Chunlan Cup, but he lost to Zhou Ruiyang again. At the 3rd place deciding match, he defeated Kim Jiseok 9p and took the 3rd place on June 1, 2015.


An Jungki was born in 1997, and he's yeongusaeng (Korean insei) at the moment.

He's ranked #6 in yeongusaeng, but he had a chance to participate the preliminaries in this LG Cup, because a few amateur players are invited to participate.

He defeated Zhu Yuanhao 4p (ranked #39 in China), Liao Yuanhe 2p, An Joyoung 9p in the preliminaries, and he played against Kim Seungjae 6p, who is ranked #10 in Korea in the final of the preliminaries.

An defeated Kim Seungjae, and he proceeded himself to the main tournament.

He was the first amateur player who survived through the preliminaries in the history of LG Cup, so it was already quite amazing.

In an interview, after An won the final of the preliminaries, he said that he hoped to play against Chen Yaoye in the main tournament. That’s because he likes Chen's style of play with the special sense of haengma, even though An likes fighting from the beginning.

I couldn't find any questionable moves for White since Black cut the center with A to C (59 and 61). That means either White's opening was troublesome or An played wonderfully in that fighting. I think both.

An Jungki 5d amateur defeated Chen Yaoye 9p, and that was very sensational.

As we've watched this game, we can see that An's level is already quite high. l. I couldn't find any serious mistakes from him, and he managed the whole game very well after he took the lead of the game.

I don't think there're many top players who can defeat Chen Yaoye compeletely like An did in the game.

The opening was peaceful, but An played lively and boldly in the bottom left, and he got a good result.

White made a mistake at A (36), and Black was happy up to B (47). 

Black's cutting with C and D (59 and 61)  were very severe and powerful, and the trade up to E was very successful for Black. 

White started to play more agressively with F, and White skillfully reduced Black's right side up to G, but the game was still good for Black.

Black H (141) was the winning shot, and An's endgame was absolutely solid and accurate.

Congratulations to An Jungki, and hopefully he'll soon turn into a pro, and see his playing again in the international matches in the near future.

On the other hand, that must have been shocking defeat for Chen Yaoye, but I hope he'll soon recover from it, and come back with his think and solid style of play.

I hope you to enjoy watching this incredible game more with the commentary, and if you have any questions or opinions, please feel free to leave a comment.

Thanks,
