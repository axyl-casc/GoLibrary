The game was played between Tang Weixing 9p and Lee Sedol 9p on September 1, 2015, in Guangzhou, China.

Tang Weixing is ranked #10 in China, and he was the winner of the 2013 Samsung Cup.

He defeated Park Junghwan 9p in the semifinals to reach the final of the 2013 Samsung Cup, and he faced against Lee Sedol.

Many Go fans expected Lee Sedol would add another international title, because Tang was still quite unknown by that time.

However, Tang showed his strength and power, and defeated Lee Sedol by 2-0 to win his first career title.

He even hadn't won any domestic titles by then, but surprisingly he won an international title.

With his victory, Chinese players completed to sweep all the international individual tournaments in 2013 for the first time.

In 2014, he won the 13th Xinan Wang by defeating Chang Hao 9p in the final, and he won the 14th Xinan Wang again by defeating Shi Yue 9p, who is ranked #1 in China, this year.

Tang's style of play is territorial and persistent. He is very good at sabaki, so he doesn't mind complicated battles in his opponent's area.

In this MLily Cup, Tang defeated Yuki Satoshi 9p, Kong Jie 9p and Li Qincheng 1p respectively to reach the quarter finals.


Lee Sedol is currently ranked #2 in Korea just after Park Junghwan 9p.

Kim Jiseok 9p used to be #2 for more than a year, but Lee came back to #2 with a higher winning percentage lately.

He recently won 27th Asian TV Cup, just four days before this game. He played wonderfully against Park Junghwan 9p in the final, and added a 4th Asian TV Cup to his international record.

He didn't add any domestic titles in 2015 yet, but he is still very powerful when he is in good form.

Lee lost to Tang Weixing in the 2013 Samsung Cup final, so this was a revenge match for him.

They didn't play in any other tournaments, and this was their 3rd game each other.

In this MLily Cup, Lee defeated Xie Erhao 2p, Byun Sangil 4p and Ding Hao 2p respectively from the round of 64.

Lee Sedol won the game and he proceeded to the semifinals.

Lee showed his fighting spirit and extraordinary sabaki technique at the top with A and B. 

Lee seems to be in very good form lately, and let's see how he's going to play in the semifinals against Ahn Seongjun 5p some day in October, 2015.

Tang's opening was fine, but one wrong direction at C made him behind, and he didn't grasp any good chances to reverse the game after that.

That's a pity that Tang didn't do very well in the international scene after winning the 2013 Samsung Cup, but he'll still have potential to become stronger with his unique persistent style of play.

I hope you to understand and enjoy watching this interesting game more with this commentary, and if you have any questions or opinions, please feel free to leave a comment.
