Park Younghun won the first game from the round of 32, group stage from the 2015 Samsung Cup.

That was a very impressive game by Park Younghun. He leaded the game with his pace from the opening, and he maintained his lead until the end.

I couldn't find any mistakes from him in this game, and his play was perfect after he took the lead with A (98).
