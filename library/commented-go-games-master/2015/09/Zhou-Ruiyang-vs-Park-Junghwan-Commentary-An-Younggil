It was played by Zhou Ruiyang 9p and Park Junghwan 9p on August 30, 2015, in Guangzhou, China.


Park Junghwan has held the #1 more than two years in Korea.

He won the 19th LG Cup in February, 2015, by defeating Kim Jiseok 9p, and that was his second international title.

he probed that he's ranked #1 in the world according to Dr Bai Taeil’s rating system, which is used by the Korean Baduk Association.

In June, 2015, he reached the final of the 27th Asian TV Cup, but he lost to Lee Sedol 9p.

His style of play is hard to describe. That’s because he plays very flexibly and his moves are well balanced between the power and skill. He’s not very good at attacking, and that seems to be his only weakness so far.


Zhou Ruiyang is currently ranked #5 in China.

He won the 1st Bailing Cup by defeating Chen Yaoye 9p in early 2013, and that was his first international title.

In 2014, he proceeded to the final of the 18th LG Cup to challenge for another title, but he lost to Tuo Jiaxi 9p.

In June, 2015, Zhou was in the final of the 10th Chunlan Cup, but he didn't succeed to add another international title by losing against Gu Li 9p.

His style of play is practical and cool, and he's very good at shape. However, he's very weak against Park Junghwan, and he only won 1 out of 9 before this game. 

That's very unbalanced between world champion players, and let's see if Zhou found his secret strategy against his natural enemy in this game.]RE[B+Resign]

White resigned at the move of 185.

Zhou Ruiyang defeated his natural enemy Park Junghwan, and proceeded to the quarter finals of the 2nd MLily Cup.

This was Zhou's second victory against Park, out of ten.

This was Zhou's wonderful game, and he didn't give Park any chances to catch up after he took the lead at around A (73). 

B (75) was a nice counter, and Black's middle game was cool and seamless.

Meanwhile, Park didn't show his strength in this game. He made a mistake at C (56), and started to be behind. He didn't have any good chances to fight properly, partly because Zhou's middle game was excellent.

After winning this game, Zhou faced against Park Younghun 9p at the quarter finals, but Zhou lost, and he didn't go further.

I hope you to understand and enjoy this smooth game more with this commentary, and if you have any qustions or opinions, please feel free to leave a comment.
