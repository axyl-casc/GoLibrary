The game was played between Yamashita Keigo 9p and Iyama Yuta 9p on June 29 and 30, 2015, in Osaka, Japan.


Yamashita Keigo won six games and lost one in the 70th Honinbo league, and he became the challenger.

Game 1 of the Honinbo title match was started on May 13 and 14, 2015, and Iyama Yuta won the game.

Iyama won next two more games, and Yamashita had to face a kadodan (a potentially match deciding game) in game 4.

Yamashita played wonderfully in game 4, and Iyama resigned at the move of 128.

This is game 5 of the 70th Honinbo, and the score of the series was 3-1 for Iyama's favor.


Iyama Yuta has been arguably the strongest Go player in Japan for quite a few years now, and he was holding four major titles, including the Kisei, Meijin and Gosei when this match was played.

Iyama challenged Yamashita Keigo for 67th Honinbo in 2012, and won his first Honinbo title with a 4-3 score.

In 2013, Iyama defeated Takao Shinji 9p 4-3 to defend the title and in 2014, he defended again against Ida Atsushi 8p, winning the title match with 4-1.

Iyama's style of play is thick and powerful, and his reading is sharp and accurate as well.


Yamashita Keigo was playing to win his 3rd Honinbo title.

Yamashita challenged Hane Naoki 9p for 65th Honinbo in 2010, and won his first Honinbo title with a 4-1 score.

In 2011, Hane Naoki was the challenger, but Yamashita won the return match with a 4-3 score to defend his Honinbo.

However, he was defeated by Iyama Yuta in 2012, and this was his first return match after he lost the Honinbo title.

Yamashita's last title was the 22nd Ryusei in 2013, and his last major title was the 37th Meijin in 2012. After that, he hasn't gained any other titles because he lost many important matches against Iyama Yuta.

Iyama Yuta seems to be a big obstacle for Yamashita, and that'd be interesting to see if he will find Iyam's weaknesses in his game in the future.

Iyama Yuta won game 5, and he defended the 70th Honinbo with 4-1 score.

Iyama showed his power and strength at the top against Black's invasion, and that was very fierce and impressive. Yamashita's sabaki was also profound and sharp, and that battle was the highlight of the game.

Yamashita played a wonderful game, but his one slack move at A was critical, and Iyama didn't miss out the chance. After the slack move, Iyama didn't give Black any chances to catch up, and that was incredible. 

The style of the game was relatively straightforward, but there were still many moves and things to read, which weren't appeared on the board.

Iyama Yuta and Yamashita Keigo made another masterpiece together, but the winner was Iyama again.

I hope you to understand and enjoy watching this beautiful game more with the commentary, and if you have any opinion or questions, please feel free to leave a comment.
