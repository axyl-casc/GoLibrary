C[This game is from the 2013 Samsung Cup, round of 16.

The game was played between Lee Sedol 9p and Chen Yaoye 9p on October 8, 2013, in Daejeon, Korea.


Lee Sedol and Chen Yaoye already played each other in the group stage of this Samsung Cup, and Chen won the game. However, Lee defeated Komatsu Hideki 9p to pass through the group stage, and they faced in the round of 16 again.

They also played at the 9th Chunlan Cup final in June 2013, and Chen defeated Lee to win the title with a 2-1 score. That was Chen Yaoye's first career international title, and it seemed as if Chen's period had begun.

After Chen won the 9th Chunlan Cup, many Go fans regarded him as the strongest player in the world. That's because both Chen and Lee were ranked #1 in China and Korea, so their final was regarded as a grand final. 

The title deciding game of the Chunlan Cup was a masterpiece of these two players.


Lee Sedol was in deep slump in the 1st half of 2013. He lost to Park Junghwan 9p in the 14th Maxim Cup final, and he was also defeated by Kim Jiseok 9p in the 18th GS Caltex Cup final. 

However, he was getting better from the slump in the 2nd half of 2013, and he was in good form again when this game was played. 

Many of his fans still considered him as the best player, and he needed to show his power and strength in the international matches like this Samsung Cup.

Their head to head records before this game was tie with 5-5. However, Chen was winning their last three games in a row, and I assume that this would have been a tough game for Lee.

Chen was very strong against top Korean players by that time, partly because his style of play was solid and defensive, and he hardly makes mistakes when he was in good form. He was getting stronger against Lee as well.

Anyway, let's have a look at their dynamic game.]

C[Black won by 0.5 point. 

Lee Sedol won the revenge match, and he proceeded to the quarter finals of the 2013 Samsung Cup.

The opening was playable for both, and the game was even through the middle game. There was a big trade in the top right corner, and the game was still well balanced after the big fighting. 

White took the lead with the brilliant move at A, and Chen maintained his lead for a while. Hane at B was Lee's fighting spirit, and the game becamevery complicated. 

Unfortunately, Chen made a small mistake at C, and it costed the game. Lee's endgame afterwards was perfect, and he saved the smallest margin.

Lee was behind in the endgame stage, but he tried to make the game complicated very hard, and the game was eventually reversed.

Meanwhile, it must be a regretful game by Chen Yaoye. He found an amazing move at A, when everybody thought he was in trouble, and he took the lead. Chen hardly loses hid leading games in the endgame, but, he couldn't maintain his lead until the very end this time.

This game was very important for Lee Sedol. That's because he was in the losing streask against Chen, but he can wish to rebound from winning this game. 

After winning this game, Lee defeated Qiu Jun 9p and Wu Guangya 6p in the quarter finals and semifinals respectively. However, he lost to Tang Weixing 9p in the final, and he got the 2nd place in the 2013 Samsung Cup.

The game was interesting and exciting to watch, mainly because Lee and Chen's moves were exceptional and profound. I'll be happy if you can feel both players' thoughts and plans a bit more with this commentary. 

If you have any questions or opinions, please feel free to leave a comment.
