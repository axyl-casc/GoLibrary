GN[Zen19S-vs-fj-20151003]PW[Franz-Josef Dickhut]PB[Zen19S]WR[6d]DT[2015-10-03]EV[2nd Codecentric Go Challenge]RO[Game 1]PC[KGS Go Server]WT[Human]BT[Computer]SO[https://gogameguru.com/]AN[An Younggil 8p]C[The 2nd Codecentric Go Challenge began on October 3, 2015, with the computer Go program Zen challenging 11 time German Go champion Franz-Josef Dickhut (aka FJ) in the first game of a best of five match.

The Codecentric Go Challenge is an annual best of five match between a top computer Go program and a top amateur Go player.

The first iteration of the tournament was held in 2014 and the event is sponsored by Codecentric - an IT consulting company based in Germany.

In 2014, Dickhut defeated CrazyStone (another top Go AI) with a 3-1 score, after losing the first game. This year, he's facing CrazyStone's rival, Zen.

Zen is the brainchild of two people - Yoji Ojima and Hideki Kato - who together form Team DeepZen, based in Japan.

For this match, Zen is using a parallelized implementation of its code, developed by Hideki. This means that it can efficiently carry out many calculations simultaneously (in parallel) when it has access to a computer cluster (multiple computers at once). This version of Zen is stronger than the commercial version when clustered.

Zen is running on a four PC cluster consisting of:

A dual 12-core Xeon E5-2690 v3 at 2.6 GHz, with 32 GB RAM,
a dual 10-core Xeon E5-2690 v2 at 3 GHz, with 32 GB RAM,
a dual 6-core Xeon X5680 at 3.5 GHz, with 8 GB RAM, and
an 8-core Core i7 5960X at 3 GHz, with 16 GB RAM.

And Dickhut is running on a human brain ;)

For more information about the match and to read an interview with both teams, please visit the Codecentric website: https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2015/10/codecentric-go-challenge-2015/

The next game will be played this weekend, on Saturday October 17, at 2:00 PM German time. That's Saturday, 17 October at:

5:00 AM US Pacific Daylight Time
8:00 AM US Eastern Daylight Time
12:00 PM UTC
2:00 PM Central European Summer Time
9:00 PM Japanese Standard Time, and
11:00 PM Australian Eastern Daylight Time.

Black 231 wasn't necessary, but Zen was sure about his winning, so he reinforced one more move in the middle of his territory.

The game was high quality, and I could find lots of nice moves and tesuji in this game from both sides.

I can see Zen's improvement since I watched his games against Takemiya Masaki 9p played in March 2012. https://gogameguru.com/zen-computer-go-program-beats-takemiya-masaki-4-stones/

Zen seems to be particularly very good at playing in the center area and sacrificing his stones. Zen used to be relatively weak at ko fight, but there weren't any chances to see his development from this game.

Meanwhile, Dickhut also played quite well, and he showed beautiful haengma from White 30 to 40. He maintained his lead up to the early endgame stage smoothly, but he didn't manage the close combat very well in the top left corner area, and Zen managed to reverse the game with completing a huge territory in the center.

I hope you to enjoy watching this interesting and impressive game between human and machine with this commentary, and if you have any questions or opinions, please feel free to leave a comment.
