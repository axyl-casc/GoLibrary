;LB[pq:3]C[White sometimes approaches a 4-4 stone at the 6-6 point in handicap go, expecting black to jump in one direction or the other, with the intent to jump down to the other 4-6 point. But this is not a handicap game, and black 3 is not on the star point. Playing 10 here just invites black to complete his shimari. So although 10 can run away easily enough, it is not really doing any damage to black - on the contrary, it induces Black to play a move that he wanted to play anyway. And White has plenty of alternatives.]W[no]
;B[po]
;LB[fq:5][jp:7][no:10]C[White now has a problem. 10 was in a funny place, so it is hard to find somewhere to play 12 that makes 10 look like a good move. Running away now with a jump up the board (say) would just encourage black to add more scale and strength to his framework. 12 as played looks like an attempt to prepare for an attack on the two black stones to the left, 5 and 7. But black will just take the opportunity with 13 to strengthen.

The point here is that forcing moves which, when answered, leave you with a better position, are good. But here, White has forced black to play moves he wanted to play anyway, and has not generated a profit for himself. So, not good!]W[mp]
;B[dr]
;LB[po:11]C[This would have been one of the options for 10, but now with 11 on the boardâ€¦]W[qh]
;C[... 15 is ideal.]B[qk]
;LB[pf:9][qh:14]C[This is a good move. If White had jumped towards the centre from 14, black would have jumped towards the centre from 9, and white would have lost potential along the top, and still be burdened with two unsettled groups below. Playing 16 as in the game starts building a white moyo along the top, and gives black the problem of trying to make profit from the unsettled white groups. This is not easy!]W[ne]
(
;LB[ne:16]C[16 means that a white peep at the marked point is quite powerful, so black should play solidly, i.e. the diagonal move one point above 17, not the knight's move as in the game. If black is going to play out towards the centre (correct) and not grovel in the corner, he should make sure he does not get cut.]TR[qe]B[oh]
;W[qe]
;B[pe]
;W[qf]
;LB[oh:17]C[Black would like to play 21 in the corner, but then white 21 would be good shape and cut through the knight's move. So black has to play 21 as in the game to keep connected to 17, and white can play in the corner to settle his group and leave Black with a string of stones with white both sides. 17 should have been a diagonal move.]TR[qd]B[pg]
;C[Playing 22 here settles the group well enough, and threatens to reduce black's bottom right area. But if black answers locally, his corner will be very strong and he will be in a position to attack the two white stones (10 and 12). Of course, black can also tenuki as he does in the game. White could instead have settled his group by playing up towards the corner at A, which would be sente because of the threat to hane at B. Playing that way would deprive the black string of stones of any potential base in the corner, and keep white's options open in the bottom right.]L[qd][pc]W[ri]

;LB[ci:29][cq:30]C[Black should play 31 at A first. Because 29 was a wide extension, a white play at B would threaten an invasion and thus be sente (and 30 should have been at B for that reason). Playing 31 at A would prevent that, extend black's territory, and reduce white's corner territory. And there is a good chance white would want to answer it, thus enabling black to get to 31 as in the game anyway.]L[cl][ck]B[om]

(
;LB[kq:41]C[Playing 43 here gives white a choice of which side to cut. Better to accept that territory is being lost in exchange for getting 41 on the board, and to play 43 one point below at the 3-3 point. This forms a live group in the corner with some territory, and does not help White make eyes by giving him an easy capture.]B[qp]

(
;C[The usual hane-and-connect sequence is fine for white here.]W[bn]
;LB[fd:24]C[This is clearly a turning point in the game.

A quick estimate of potential territories suggests that black is a little ahead, even allowing for komi, until white's territory at the top is counted. Black needs to keep this down to not much more than 10, or if more, black needs to add to his own territory. So, what to do?

Option 1 is to play a move at A - the junction of 2 moyos - allowing white to strengthen his moyo, but adding to Black's. There is no obvious white response that completely prevents black then reducing/invading, but clearly that will then be a bit of a fight.

Option 2 is a full-blooded invasion, somewhere in the middle on the 3rd line. It looks like there is enough room to live if penned in, or to run away. Black may just be able to make something of the fact that the two marked white stones do not yet have a base, even though they can settle quickly enough playing at the marked points.

Option 3 is a reduction like 57 in the game. Reducing moves are usually safe, but may not be severe enough. The problem in this game is that 57 can be answered with white A, which black would really want to answer locally. And white may well have another forcing move or two around B before turning to answer 57. Of course, black may not answer white A, in which case mayhem would ensue.

It is hard to know what to do in situations like this. It probably depends as much is anything on preferred styles of play.]TR[lb][ne][pb][nc]L[ff][ei]B[je]

(
;LB[jc:58][nc:8][ne:16]C[White should play 60 at A. It is probably sente, but even if black does not respond, it looks like the most that it will cost white would be the loss of 16 while connecting 58 and 8. And white would be able to follow up from A.]L[ff]W[ld]

(
;C[66 here clearly doesn't do the job. White would like to play C, but a black answer at the marked point is a good response. White can play at A, followed by black B et cetera.
