"\n" +
"This was the second game in a ten game match between Fujisawa Hosai 9p and Go Seigen 9p. It was played on February 25 and 26, 1943.\n" +
"\n" +
"Go Seigen is regarded as the greatest Go player in the history of Go. We refer to him as a 'living legend' in Korea. \n" +
"\n" +
"He was born on June 12, 1914, so next year (in 2014), he'll celebrate his 100th birthday. By the way, according to the way age is counted in some Asian cultures, Go Seigen will turn 100 this year (in 2013).\n" +
"\n" +
"His style of play was so different from other top pros at the time, and he won nearly all of his ten game matches (jubango).\n" +
"\n" +
"The only ten game match Go Seigen lost was this series against Fujisawa Hosai (4-6 in Fujisawa's favor). However, Fujisawa was taking black in all games and there was no komi. They played with a handicap called 'josen' (black in all games) because Go Seigen was 8 dan and Fujisawa was 6 dan at the time.\n" +
"\n" +
"Fujisawa Hosai was very famous for his mirror Go. He kept experimenting with mirror Go because he wanted to learn all about it.\n" +
"\n" +
"He didn't just mimic though, he spent more time than his opponents did, and he often got into byo-yomi situations (was short of time) in the middle game. He played with the sort of full concentration that Cho Chikun 9p does.\n" +
"\n" +
"There were two famous players named Fujisawa in the Japanese Go world. Fujisawa Shuko (Hideyuki) 9p was the uncle of Fujisawa Hosai, even though he was 6 years younger.\n" +
"\n" +
"Fujisawa Hosai was also the first professional player to be promoted to 9 dan under the Japanese Oteai system (Go Seigen was the second). They played two more ten game matches on even terms when they were both 9 dan (the only two 9 dans at the time) and Go Seigen won both of them.\n" +
